# Agent

Agent is a powerful design pattern in which nodes can take dynamic actions based on the context.

The core of building **high-performance** and **reliable** agents boils down to:

1. **Context Management:** Provide *relevant, minimal context.* For example, rather than including an entire chat history, use [RAG](./rag.md) to retrieve only the most relevant parts. Even if LLMs have larger context windows, they can exhibit the ["lost in the middle"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), often focusing on the start and end portions of the context while disregarding the middle.

2. **Action Space:** Define *a well-structured and unambiguous* set of actions. Avoid overlapping actions like `read_databases` and `read_csvs`. Instead, unify data sources (e.g., import CSVs into a database) and design a single action. That action can be parameterized (e.g., a search string) or made programmable (e.g., SQL queries).

Agent Implementation Steps:

1. **Context and Action:** Implement nodes that supply context and perform actions.  
2. **Branching:** Connect action nodes with an agent node, using [branching](../core_abstraction/flow.md) to direct the flow to other action nodes, and potentially loop back.  
3. **Agent Node:** Provide a promptâ€”for example:

```python
"""
Here is the context: {context}

Here are the actions:
1. Name: search
   Description: Use web search to get results
   Parameters:
      query: str of what to search
2. Name: answer
   Description: Conclude based on the results
   Parameters:
      result: str of what to answer

Now decide your action by returning:
```yaml
thinking: |
    Based on the context, ...
action: search or answer
parameters:
    ...
```"""
```

### Example: Search Agent

This agent:
1. Decides whether to search or answer
2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
3. Answers when enough context gathered

```python
class DecideAction(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
        query = shared["query"]
        return query, context
        
    def exec(self, inputs):
        query, context = inputs
        prompt = f"""
Given input: {query}
Previous search results: {context}
Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
Output in yaml:
```yaml
action: search/answer
reason: why this action
search_term: search phrase if action is search
```"""
        resp = call_llm(prompt)
        yaml_str = resp.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
        result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
        
        assert isinstance(result, dict)
        assert "action" in result
        assert "reason" in result
        assert result["action"] in ["search", "answer"]
        if result["action"] == "search":
            assert "search_term" in result
        
        return result

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        if exec_res["action"] == "search":
            shared["search_term"] = exec_res["search_term"]
        return exec_res["action"]

class SearchWeb(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["search_term"]
        
    def exec(self, search_term):
        return search_web(search_term)
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        prev_searches = shared.get("context", [])
        shared["context"] = prev_searches + [
            {"term": shared["search_term"], "result": exec_res}
        ]
        return "decide"
        
class DirectAnswer(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["query"], shared.get("context", "")
        
    def exec(self, inputs):
        query, context = inputs
        return call_llm(f"Context: {context}\nAnswer: {query}")

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
       print(f"Answer: {exec_res}")
       shared["answer"] = exec_res

# Connect nodes
decide = DecideAction()
search = SearchWeb()
answer = DirectAnswer()

decide - "search" >> search
decide - "answer" >> answer
search - "decide" >> decide  # Loop back

flow = Flow(start=decide)
flow.run({"query": "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024?"})
```
